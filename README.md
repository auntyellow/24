# 24 Game Solver
[24 Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Game) Solver: gives you all dissimilar solutions. [Try it!](http://ns1.xqbase.com:8080/24.html)

## Similar Solutions
For example, for the card with the numbers 2, 3, 6, Q(12), possible solutions are:

    2 + 4 + 6 + 12 = 24
    4 × 6 ÷ 2 + 12 = 24
    12 ÷ 4 × (6 + 2) = 24
    ...

Here similar solutions are filtered out, e.g.

    2 + 4 + 6 + 12 = 24
    (12 + 6) + (4 + 2) = 24   // associativity
    4 × 6 ÷ 2 + 12 = 24
    6 ÷ 2 × 4 + 12 = 24       // commutativity

We have other similar situations, e.g.

    4 × 6 + 5 - 5 = 24
    4 × 6 × 5 / 5 = 24        // useless duplicated numbers

    12 × (13 × 1 - 11) = 24
    12 × (13 ÷ 1 - 11) = 24   // useless 1

    (2 + 2) × (3 + 3) = 24
    2 × 2 × (3 + 3) = 24      // 2 + 2 = 2 × 2

    (2 × 6 - 6) × 4 = 24
    (6 + 6) ÷ 2 × 4 = 24      // 2 × a - a = (a + a) ÷ 2

## Algorithms
We need a set of all inequivalent expressions involving 4 operands. E.g. `a × b ÷ c + d = d + a ÷ c × b`, so we have `a × b ÷ c + d` in this set but not `d + a ÷ c × b`.

We listed all expressions by combination of parenthesis skeletons, operand positions and operators. Then we tested each expression with 4 random numbers (and run several times to avoid collision). Equivalent expressions always have same result, and vice versa. Finally, we found out 1,170 (matches with sequence [A140606](http://oeis.org/A140606)) inequivalent expressions.

For 4 different numbers (`a, b, c, d`), we can test each expression to check whether it equals to 24. E.g. `2, 3, 6, 12`, there are `a + b + c + d`, `b × c ÷ a + d` and other 8 expressions match to 24.

But this does not work for 4 numbers with 2 same `(a, b, c, c)`, or with `1` (`1, a, b, c`), or with `2`, ... So we must have other sets of inequivalent expressions:

    a, a, b, c // two a's may be commuted, or may be useless
    a, a, b, b
    a, a, a, b
    a, a, a, a
    1, a, b, c // 1 may be useless
    1, a, a, b
    1, a, a, a
    1, 1, a, b
    1, 1, a, a
    1, 1, 1, a
    2, 2, a, b // 2 + 2 = 2 × 2
    2, 2, a, a
    2, 2, 2, a
    1, 2, 2, a
    2, a, a, b // 2 × a - a = (a + a) ÷ 2

In our JavaScript programs, [pregen.js](https://github.com/auntyellow/24/blob/master/pregen.js) generated these sets of inequivalent expressions and saved as [24-expressions.js](https://github.com/auntyellow/24/blob/master/24-expressions.js). [24.js](https://github.com/auntyellow/24/blob/master/pregen.js) just decides which set is used and find out all matched expressions.

For situation `a, a', b, c` where `a' = a + 1`, we must consider that `a' - a` may be useless. So we must filter out all expressions that contain `(a' - a) ×`, `× (a' - a)` and `÷ (a' - a)`, then try `b + c` and `b × c` in addition.

## Defects

`1, 1, 5, 5` has only one dissimilar solution, because we regard `(a + 1) × (a - 1)` and `a × a - 1 × 1` as the same.

`2, 4, 6, 6` has a pair of solutions that seems similar: `(6 - (4 - 2)) × 6` (A) and `(6 - 4 ÷ 2) × 6` (B), but we have not considered `4 - 2` similar to `4 ÷ 2`.

`2, 4, 6, 6` has another pair of solutions that seems similar: `(6 - 4 + 2) × 6` (C) and `(6 - 4) × 2 × 6` (D), but we have not considered `(a" - a) + 2` similar to `(a" - a) × 2` where `a" = a + 2`.

It is hard to implement the above two considerations, because A is similar to C obviously but B is not similar to D at all.

## Combination with the most solutions
`2, 4, 8, 10` has 11 solutions:

    10 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 24
    (10 - 4) × 8 ÷ 2 = 24
    (10 × 4 + 8) ÷ 2 = 24
    ((10 + 2) × 8 ÷ 4 = 24
    10 × 2 + 8 - 4 = 24
    (10 - 2) × 4 - 8 = 24
    8 × 4 - 10 + 2 = 24
    (8 ÷ 4 + 10) × 2 = 24
    (8 × 2 - 10) × 4 = 24
    (10 - 8 ÷ 2)) × 4 = 24
    10 × 4 - 8 × 2 = 24
